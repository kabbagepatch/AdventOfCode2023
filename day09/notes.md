Couple things to realise to solve part one this problem. One, the extrapolated value for each sequence is just the sum of the last element in each subsequent sequence. And two, don't use sum to see if all elements are zero when there are negative numbers invovled haha

For part two, very similar logic, but just alternatively add and subtract the first element of the subsequent sequences, coz a - (b - (c - d)) = a - b + c - d
