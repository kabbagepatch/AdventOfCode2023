This was a fun problem. Thie frst part was fairly simple. I just had to traverse the loop starting at S and count the number of steps to come back to S. The answer was half that number. To traverse the loop, I made a function that returned the next step in the path by just checking what kind of pipe we're on, and what pipes are around, and finding a match.

The second problem was a bit more complex. However, I remembered looking into something like this for a take-home exercise a long time ago. Jogging my memory and doing some searches on old projects, I found out this was a "point in a polygon" problem. And the solution was counting the number of walls from your point to the edge of the map. If the number of walls is even, the point is outside the loop. Otherwise, it's inside. The only special case I had to take into account was if a point was along a horizontal line of the loop. But after that, it was happy days
